# This is My WordPress Boilerplate Theme

There are many of it but this one is mine.

## Installation

If you are using git to clone the repository do the following:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/jancbeck/My-Wordpress-Boilerplate-Theme.git
    
Move humans.txt and .htaccess to your WordPress root. Install recommended plugins.

## Features

* Uses `style.css` for theme info and LESS generated files in `/css` for styling. Register your own stylesheets and use concatenation plugins.
* Sets up jQuery in no conflict mode in footer but makes `$` function available in a closure. Use the `project` object to register globally namespaced JS variables.
* Includes a blank screenshot file for the theme. Open, edit, save.
* Conditional classes for IE version stylings for the `<html>` element
* `no-js` / `js` class on `<html>` for progressively enhanced websites
