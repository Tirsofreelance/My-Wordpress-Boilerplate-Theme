# This is My WordPress Boilerplate
There are many of it but this one is mine.

## Installation

If you are using git to clone the repository do the following:

    git clone --recursive git://github.com/jancbeck/My-Wordpress-Boilerplate theme

If you are downloading the zip or tar don't forget to get the [wp-less](https://github.com/sanchothefat/wp-less) and [lessphp](https://github.com/leafo/lessphp) double dependency and copy it into the `libs/wp-less/` folder. In the end there should be a `lessc` folder inside of a `wp-less` folder inside of `libs`.
