# This is My WordPress Boilerplate Theme
There are many of it but this one is mine.

## Installation

If you are using git to clone the repository do the following:

    git clone --recursive git://github.com/jancbeck/My-Wordpress-Boilerplate
    
Move humans.txt and .htaccess to your WordPress root. Install recommended plugins.

## What it does

* IE8+ Support
* Uses `style.css` for theme info and LESS generated files in `/css` for styling. Register your own stylesheets.
* Sets up jQuery in footer and in no conflict mode but makes `$` function available in closure. Use `project` object to register global namespaced JS variables.
* Includes a blank screenshot file for the theme. Open, edit, save.
* Conditional classes for IE version stylings on `<html>`
* `no-js` / `js` class on `<html>` for progressively enhanced websites
* `.htaccess` uses many HTML5 Boilerplate settings to optimize caching behavior and security
